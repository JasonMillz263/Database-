# Student Login System

This project is a **Student Login System** using:

- **Firebase Authentication** (for login)
- **Firebase Firestore** (for student data)
- Hosted on **GitHub Pages**

## How it works

1. Students open the login page (`index.html`)
2. Enter their email & password
3. After login, they are redirected to their **dashboard** (`student.html`)
4. Student data is loaded securely from Firebase Firestore

## Project Files

- `index.html` → Login page  
- `student.html` → Student dashboard  

## Setup Notes

- GitHub Pages must be enabled in **Settings → Pages → Branch: main / Folder: root**
- Firebase must have Authentication & Firestore configured
- Add students in Firebase Authentication & Firestore
